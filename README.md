# Loan_Prediction

Hello Everyone I am just trying to learn how to use git-hub, since i am dumb i am trying to just learn what happens when i do something. I dont know if the actual owner will be offended
The entire project is different ways of predictive modelling based on  "Loan-Prediction"
In this case Study u will Learn everything such as :
* Binary Classification
* Multiclassification
* Univariant Anlaysis
* Missing Values and Outliers Treatements
* Bivariate Analysis
* Model Building
* Logistic Regression using stratified k-folds cross validation
* Feature Engineering
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
I am putting it here for the sake of learning, by tweaking each elements one at a time and seeing what changes. If you are a novice like me,
You can let me know your questions so that i will have more questions to think on, maybe i will have no answers.
